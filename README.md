#### Observations

1. There are five categories of cassava images.

2. The images are generally large in size. This would imply that a lot of computation will take place.

4. The sizes of the images vary. This would require us to ensure that the images are of the same size.

5. The image classes are imbalanced. This might require the use of specialized metrics for evaluation, such as __ROC AUC__.
